# 👋 Hi, I'm Dr. Hong Xie

**PhD (Dr.) in Computer Vision & Medical Imaging**

I work on **robust, explainable, and deployable healthcare AI**, integrating **medical imaging**, **wearable sensor data**, and **multimodal learning**.

**Focus:** Multi-task Learning • Vision–Language Models (VLMs) • Explainable AI (XAI)

---

## 🔬 Research Areas
- Skin lesion analysis (classification & segmentation)
- Wearable sensor intelligence (physiological time-series)
- Multimodal AI (image + sensor + metadata)
- Robust & lightweight models for real-world deployment

---

## 🛠️ Stack
Python • PyTorch • Computer Vision • Time-Series • Multimodal AI

---

## 🤝 Collaboration

Open to collaboration and problem-solving discussions in medical imaging, wearable sensing, and multimodal healthcare AI.
